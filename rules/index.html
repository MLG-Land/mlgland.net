		<h1>Rules</h1>
		<p>
			<b>1. No Swearing</b>
		</p>
		<p>
			As Minecraft is rated for children under the age of 13, you will not be allowed to use any vulgar language
			in the server. Since the Discord ToS state that you must be 13 or older you are free to use any non-racist
			language in the discord server.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>2. No Spamming</b>
		</p>
		<p>
			You are not allowed to spam in both the Minecraft and Discord servers. This includes using commands in a
			short period of time. This rule is for your own convenience. (The server could get overloaded if you spam
			too much)
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>3. No Advertising</b>
		</p>
		<p>
			You are not allowed to advertise in the server. This includes using the server to advertise for other
			servers.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>4. No Cheating/Hacking</b>
		</p>
		<p>
			You are not allowed to use any hacks or cheats in the server. This includes using known minecraft exploits
			to your advantage.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>5. No Begging For Ranks</b>
		</p>
		<p>
			Want a great way to get your rank taken away? This is one! (this is a joke you will be muted for begging)
